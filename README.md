Urania — Pepper’s Ghost Installation & Documentation

Everything needed to fabricate, understand, and exhibit the current iteration of the Urania installation.

Urania is an interdisciplinary installation combining a Pepper’s Ghost hologram, sculptural assemblage, photographic prints, and regional energy data to examine the material and environmental costs of artificial intelligence. The project treats AI not as an abstract or immaterial system, but as infrastructure sustained by energy, labor, and attention.

What’s Included

Smartphone-compatible Pepper’s Ghost stage
3D files and build notes for a compact holographic illusion using historical stage techniques.
→ Illusion Stage/

Installation documentation
Exhibition layout considerations, material decisions, and technical notes for presenting the work in physical space.
→ About/

Data visualization context
Simplified visualizations derived from TEP/TEPC electricity-load data, situating AI infrastructure within Tucson’s regional grid.
→ data-viz/

Consultation & acknowledgments
Credits and contextual notes for individuals and institutions consulted during development.
→ Consultants & Acknowledgments/

Current Workflow (This Iteration)

QR code → opens the GitHub Pages documentation site

Smartphone → placed face-up inside the Pepper’s Ghost stage to render the holographic figure

Physical installation → floor-based sculptural assemblage, photographic prints, and data visualizations experienced in shared space

⚠️ This iteration does not include a projector loop or teaser video playback.
All materials in this repository reflect the installation as it currently exists.

About the Project

Urania operates at the intersection of speculative fiction, domestic infrastructure, and environmental accounting. The project juxtaposes a polished holographic AI figure with grounded, material evidence of extraction—corporate systems rendered through bodies, appliances, data, and power dependencies.

By staging AI within everyday space rather than the “cloud,” the installation asks how technological optimism intersects with scarcity, responsibility, and the lived costs of computation.

Future Iterations

Urania is designed as an evolving installation. Future iterations may introduce new components, reconfigure existing elements, or explore alternate exhibition formats as the project continues to develop.

Potential future directions may include:

Expanded time-based media elements

Alternative hologram content or interaction models

Additional data layers reflecting changing regional or infrastructural conditions

Any such changes will be documented clearly and versioned within this repository. This README and accompanying materials reflect the current exhibited iteration only.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a transparent, public-facing record of the project’s development. It is intended to support:

Learning and experimentation with Pepper’s Ghost techniques

Accessible documentation for artists, educators, and makers

Critical engagement with AI as a material, infrastructural system

The documentation prioritizes clarity, reproducibility, and responsible framing over spectacle.
