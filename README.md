Urania — DIY Pepper’s Ghost + Pi Projector Loop

Everything needed to fabricate and exhibit the Urania installation:

Smartphone-compatible Pepper’s Ghost stage (3D files)

Projector loop — Raspberry Pi script that auto-plays the teaser on boot

Workflow

QR code → opens a GitHub Pages site with two Urania videos:

the mirrored hologram loop for the Pepper’s Ghost stage

Smartphone → displays the mirrored hologram loop inside the Pepper’s Ghost stage

a scene from the pilot for the projector

Raspberry Pi 3 → boots directly to projector playback of the teaser, looping on startup
