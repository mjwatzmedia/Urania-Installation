Urania — DIY Pepper’s Ghost + AR/QR + Pi Projector Loop

Everything needed to fabricate and exhibit the Urania installation:

Pepper’s Ghost stage (smartphone “hologram”) — smartphone-compatible stage + TV shell (3D files)

Projector loop — Raspberry Pi 3 that auto-plays the teaser on boot

QR trigger site — GitHub Pages site hosting two teaser cuts and setup instructions

Workflow

QR code → opens a GitHub Pages site with two Urania videos:

the mirrored hologram loop for the Pepper’s Ghost stage

a scene from the pilot for the projector

Smartphone → displays the mirrored hologram loop inside the Pepper’s Ghost stage

Raspberry Pi 3 → boots directly to projector playback of the teaser, looping on startup
