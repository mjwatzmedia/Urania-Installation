Everything needed to fabricate and exhibit the Urania Installation: an iPhone-compatible Pepper’s Ghost stage with TV case (3D files); a step-by-step SOP for setting up a Raspberry Pi 3 to play and loop the teaser video on start-up; and a QR-triggered github website with two teaser cuts. Workflow: Smartphone → loops the mirrored hologram video for the stage; Raspberry Pi 3 → boots the projector into the feature teaser on autoplay at startup.
